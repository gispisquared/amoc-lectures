\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers, and let $p$ be a prime greater
    than 3. Prove that
    \[\binom{ap}{bp}\equiv\binom ab\pmod {p^3}.\]
  \item Let $n$ be a fixed positive integer. Let
    $\frac{a_1}{b_1},\ldots,\frac{a_k}{b_k}$ be the rational numbers between 0
    and 1 inclusive with denominators at most $n$, written in increasing order
    and lowest terms.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Prove that for each $i$, $a_{i+1}b_i-a_ib_{i+1}=1$.
      \item Prove that the rational number $x$ with smallest denominator such
        that $\frac{a_i}{b_i}<x<\frac{a_{i+1}}{b_{i+1}}$ is
        $\frac{a_i+a_{i+1}}{b_i+b_{i+1}}$. 
      \item Which pairs of numbers appear as consecutive $b_i$s?
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Let $p$ be a prime. What is the sum of all the generators mod $p$?
  \item
    Let $n$ be a positive integer larger than 1.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Prove that the product of all primes between $\left\lceil\frac
        n2\right\rceil$ and $n$
        (not including $\left\lceil\frac n2\right\rceil$) is less than $2^n$.
      \item Prove that the product of all primes between 1 and $n$ is at most
        $4^{n-1}$.
      \item Find some real number $c$ independent of $n$ such that there are at
        most $\frac{cn}{\log_2 n}$ primes that are at most $n$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item 
    Let $n$ be a positive integer larger than $2^{2^{2^2}}$.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Let $p$ be a prime.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Prove that if $p^k\mid\binom{2n}n$ then $p^k<
            2n$.
          \item Prove that if $2p\le 2n< 3p$ then $p\nmid\binom{2n}n$.
        \end{itemize}
      \item Prove that 
        \[\prod_{\substack{p^k\|\binom{2n}n\\ p\le n}}p^k<\binom{2n}n.\]
      \item Find some real number $c$ independent of $n$ such that there are at
        least $\frac{cn}{\log_2 n}$ primes that are at most $n$.
    \end{enumerate} 
    %\item
    %\begin{enumerate}
      %\item Let $p$ be an odd prime. Working in mod $p$, let $S$ be a set such
        %that for any nonzero $a$, $a\in S\iff -a\not\in S$.
        
        %Prove that for each $x$, $\left|xS\setminus S\right|$ is even if and
        %only if $x$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$.
      %\item Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct odd primes, such that $p$ is 1 mod 4.
      
        %Prove that $p$ is a quadratic residue mod $q$ iff $q$ is a quadratic
        %residue mod $p$.
      %\item What if instead both $p$ and $q$ are 3 mod 4?
